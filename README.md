## Random Curse Generator

Live website: https://jnicolon.github.io/Random-Curse-Generator/

A generator that randomly picks a funny curse for the user.

It was made with vanilla javascript, html, sass for css with the gsap framework for the animations.

To get the curse, there's a small mechanic of extinguishing a set of flames by clicking on them. A small function checks a counter on each flame and if they are all at cero, an animation is triggered.

The cursed are displayed randomly from an array and the resulting one is saved in the local storage. You cannont change your curse (unless you clear local storage).
